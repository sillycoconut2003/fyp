## üìä How to Use Each Feature Effectively

### **üè¢ Agency Selection**
```
Available Agencies:
‚Ä¢ NYC Transit (60.7% of data) - Subway/bus operations
‚Ä¢ Long Island Rail Road (14.5%) - Commuter rail
‚Ä¢ MTA Bus (12.1%) - Bus operations
‚Ä¢ Metro-North Railroad (10.3%) - Regional rail
‚Ä¢ Bridges and Tunnels (2.4%) - Infrastructure
```

**Best Practice**: Start with NYC Transit for most comprehensive data, then explore specialized agencies for focused analysis.

### **üìà KPI Selection**
Your dashboard covers **130+ unique indicators** including:

**Service Indicators (~79% of data)**:
- On-time performance metrics
- Completion rates by depot
- Service availability measures

**Safety Indicators (~9% of data)**:
- Accident and injury rates
- Employee safety metrics
- Equipment failure rates

**Usage Tip**: Look for patterns across similar KPIs (e.g., all depot completion rates) to identify operational best practices.

### **üîÆ Forecasting Controls**

#### **Forecast Horizon**
- **1-6 months**: Short-term operational planning
- **6-12 months**: Budget and resource allocation
- **12-24 months**: Strategic planning and capacity management

#### **Model Selection**
**Machine Learning Models**:
- **RandomForest** (MAE: 12,651): Best overall accuracy, use for reliable predictions
- **XGBoost** (MAE: 49,445): Fast processing, good for real-time analysis
- **LinearRegression** (MAE: 147,061): Baseline comparison, simple interpretation

**Time Series Models**:
- **Prophet**: Excellent for seasonal patterns and holiday effects
- **SARIMA**: Statistical approach, good for stable time series

2. Analyze across different agencies
3. Identify best-performing agencies
4. Extract operational insights for knowledge transfer
```

### **Workflow 3: Forecasting Analysis**
```
1. Select critical KPI with business impact
2. Generate 12-month forecasts with multiple models
3. Compare ML vs Time Series approaches
4. Use ensemble insights for robust planning
```

### **Workflow 4: Seasonal Pattern Detection**
```
1. Choose percentage-based indicators
2. View full historical timeline
3. Look for recurring seasonal dips/peaks
4. Plan resource allocation accordingly
```

## üìã Troubleshooting

**No Models Available**: Ensure all training scripts have been run
**Empty Data**: Check that processed data exists in data/processed/
**Slow Performance**: Select specific agencies/KPIs rather than viewing all data
**Model Errors**: Verify model files exist in models/ directory
