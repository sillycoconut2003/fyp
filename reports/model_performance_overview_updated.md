## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Unified ML Pipeline
```
All KPIs → Feature Engineering (45 features) → RandomForest → Post-Processing
                                                     ↓
                                            Percentage Bounds (0-100%)
                                                     ↓
                                            Confidence Intervals (Bootstrap)
```

### Confidence Interval Enhancement
- **Method**: Residual bootstrap (80% confidence level)
- **Coverage**: All model types (ML + Time Series)
- **Visualization**: Enhanced minimum width (0.5%) for percentage KPIs
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Preserves model uncertainty while ensuring visibility

### Percentage Bounds Application
- **Detection**: Automatic (KPI name patterns + historical data analysis)
- **Enforcement**: Applied post-prediction (preserves ML feature utilization)
- **Coverage**: `0-100%` bounds for identified percentage metrics
- **Method**: Simple clipping (no heuristic complexity)

## 📊 Performance Impact Analysis

### Overall Model Performance Changes
The optimization primarily focused on **architectural simplification** and **percentage KPI accuracy** rather than massive overall performance gains:

**RandomForest**: 13,862.7 → 13,637.3 MAE (**1.6% improvement**)
- Slight improvement maintained while removing complexity
- Consistent performance across all KPI types

**XGBoost**: 38,700.7 → 39,884.9 MAE (**3.0% degradation**)  
- Minor degradation within acceptable bounds
- Still maintains strong performance for speed-critical applications

**LinearRegression**: 130,614.0 → 130,912.1 MAE (**~unchanged**)
- Negligible change demonstrates baseline stability
- Continues to serve as transparent baseline model

### Key Optimization Win: Percentage KPIs
The **primary benefit** was the dramatic improvement in percentage-bounded metrics:
- **Previous**: Specialized percentage predictor (MAE: 2.845)
- **Current**: Vanilla RandomForest (MAE: 0.335)
- **Result**: **5x better accuracy** for percentage KPIs specifically
